# Regression_Predictive_Model
Predicting Car's Fuel economy using regression techniques

## Overview 
- Built a predictive model using data from 400+ used cars and their vehicle caracteristics. The goal was predicting a car's fuel economy given it's weight.
- Used pre-processing techniques on the data to resolve inconsistencies such as missing data and removing outiliers
- Compared a simple linear model with a curve fitting model and interpreted results, achieving  a MAE of 3.3 Miles per gallon Using an OLS regression model.
